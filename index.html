      <p>Welcome to my first bootstrap! I am a fulltime student at CSULB. Initially I was going to major in Computer Science, but then had the oppurtunity to venture off into the automotive industry, which is one of the many things I love. This then unfortunately made me change my major to something business orientated, but am intending to minor in computer science. That is where I currently am in my life, still going to school, but at the same time running a part of a business. Just a small backstory, I am from a family of 4 and I am the youger sibling in this family. I love music, sports (specifically basketball), love spending time with my family, and also love the automotive industry.</p>

      <h2>What I do at Work :-)</h2>

      <p>There are so many things that I need to oversee at work. From monitoring the website and adjusting many parts of it. Whether it be some codes or adding more products, I am always altering it. One of the many things I love to do is connecting with new clients and connecting as well with other companies to sell their products. I go to many car shows through out the week to make connections, make new friends, and possibly make new clients. One of the big things is me being a salesman as well, which is the only way for the business to survive. Another key aspect is monitoring and running social media, which is essential in the newer era of the business life. </p>
      <h2>Parts that we sell</h2>

      <p>(A picture of a popular wheel brand that we sell)</p>
      <p>Rays Wheels is one of the many brands we carry, and is also the main product that the business sells. Unfortunately, due to Covid-19, many of these wheels resulted in major lead times. These lead times were anywhere from 3 to 8 month wait. Apart from Covid, these wheels are produced straight from Japan. So many of the Covid related problems delayed so many orders, and sadly that applied to many businesses outside of the automotive industry.For more information on other brands and parts, the links on the footer direct you to both my email and website for the business! The website alone showcases some of my knowledge with coding. </p>
